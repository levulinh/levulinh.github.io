Hello, I'm Drew. Welcome to my blog! I'm an AI researcher based in Seoul, South Korea, with a passion for technology, music, and gaming. I've been living in Korea for over 4 years now.

A bit about my career, I have pursued a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. Currently, I am working as an AI researcher in Seoul. I am dedicated to exploring the possibilities and applications of artificial intelligence in various domains. Through my work, I strive to contribute to the advancement of technology and its positive impact on society.

I can speak English pretty well, as well as a little Korean (I know, what a shame ü•≤). I love rock, a huge fan of Imagine Dragons I would say. I am also a Hylian, and a resident of house Ravenclaw.

On this blog, I will be sharing my thoughts, insights, and experiences related to AI, technology, photography, and gaming. I hope to provide valuable content that sparks discussions, inspires creativity, and fosters a sense of community among like-minded individuals.

Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the fascinating realms between the artifitial intelligence and reality!
