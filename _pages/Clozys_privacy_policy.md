Welcome to Clozy! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information when you use our application. By using Clozy, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## 1. Introduction

Clozy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

## 2. No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data or information from our users. Clozy is designed to function without requiring any personal data input. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we have built our App to ensure that your data remains private and secure.

## 3. No Login Required

Clozy does not require you to create an account or log in to use the App. You can fully utilize all features of the App without providing any personal information.

## 4. Local Storage

All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, nor do we transmit any data to our servers. This means that your entries and logs are private and remain solely on your device.

## 5. Use of AI Chat Bot

Our AI chat bot, Clozy, interacts with you based on the data stored locally on your device. The chat bot does not send any information outside of the App or your device. Your conversations with Clozy are private and are not stored or monitored by us.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Clozy does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect data about you. Your use of the App is completely self-contained, and no external parties have access to your data.

## 7. Data Security

We prioritize the security of your data. Although we do not collect or store any data, we have implemented industry-standard security measures to protect your information within the App. This includes encryption and secure local storage mechanisms.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Clozy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be posted on this page, and we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
